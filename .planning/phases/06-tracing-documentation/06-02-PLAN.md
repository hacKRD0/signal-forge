<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create comprehensive README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update README.md with complete documentation:

Sections:
1. **Project Title and Description**
   - Customer & Partner Discovery Prototype
   - One-line description from BRIEF
   - Key features list

2. **Features**
   - Document upload (DOCX, PDF, CSV, PPTX)
   - AI-powered context extraction
   - Customer and partner discovery
   - Match scoring and rationale generation
   - Streamlit web interface
   - Full prompt tracing

3. **Prerequisites**
   - Python 3.9+
   - Google API key (for Google ADK)

4. **Installation**
   - Step-by-step setup instructions:
     - Clone repository (or extract archive)
     - Create virtual environment
     - Install dependencies
     - Configure environment variables
   - Clear code blocks for each command

5. **Configuration**
   - Copy .env.example to .env
   - Add Google API key
   - Explain where to get API key

6. **Usage**
   - How to run: streamlit run app.py
   - Step-by-step usage guide:
     1. Upload documents
     2. Process documents
     3. Select discovery type
     4. Add filters (optional)
     5. Generate results
     6. View results and download
   - Screenshots or text descriptions

7. **Architecture**
   - High-level architecture diagram (text-based)
   - Component overview (parsers, agent, discovery, scoring, UI, tracing)
   - Data flow explanation

8. **Output Files**
   - Explain logs/ directory structure
   - traces.jsonl format
   - run_reports.jsonl format

9. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common issues and solutions
   - API key errors
   - Dependency issues
   - No results found

10. **Limitations**
    - Local only (no cloud deployment)
    - Requires Google API key
    - Public data only (no LinkedIn scraping)

Keep README clear, concise, well-formatted with headers and code blocks

Avoid: Don't make it too long (under 300 lines). Don't include internal implementation details (high-level only).

  <name>Task 2: Finalize requirements.txt and verify dependencies</name>
  <files>requirements.txt</files>
  <action>
Review and finalize requirements.txt:
- Ensure all dependencies added during all phases present
- Add version constraints for stability (use >= for flexibility)
- Group dependencies logically with comments:
  - # Core dependencies
  - # Document parsing
  - # Agent/AI
  - # UI
  - # Testing
- Final list should include:
  - google-genai
  - python-dotenv
  - python-docx
  - PyPDF2
  - pandas
  - python-pptx
  - streamlit
  - pytest (for testing)
- Verify no duplicate entries
- Test installation: pip install -r requirements.txt in fresh venv
- Generate requirements-lock.txt with exact versions: pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt

Avoid: Don't use overly restrictive version constraints (== locks too tightly). Use >= for patch updates.
  </action>
  <verify>
- requirements.txt has all dependencies
- Grouped and commented logically
- Versions specified appropriately
- Fresh install works: pip install -r requirements.txt
- requirements-lock.txt generated with exact versions

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create additional documentation files</name>
  <files>ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/API_KEY_SETUP.md, docs/TRACING.md</files>
  <action>
Create ARCHITECTURE.md:
- Detailed architecture documentation
- Component descriptions (parsers, agent core, discovery engine, scoring, UI, tracing)
- Data models explanation
- Flow diagrams (text-based or ASCII art)
- Design decisions and rationale

Create docs/ directory

Create docs/API_KEY_SETUP.md:
- Step-by-step Google API key acquisition
- Where to go (Google AI Studio)
- How to create key
- How to configure in .env
- Security best practices (don't commit .env)

Create docs/TRACING.md:
- Explain tracing system
- JSONL file formats
  - traces.jsonl schema
  - run_reports.jsonl schema
- Example entries
- How to analyze traces
- Tools for viewing JSONL (jq, Python, text editor)

Keep docs focused and practical

Avoid: Don't duplicate README content. These are supplementary deep-dives.

# Phase 6 Plan 2: README & Documentation Summary

**Comprehensive documentation created**

## Accomplishments
- Created detailed README.md with setup and usage instructions
- Finalized requirements.txt with all dependencies
- Generated requirements-lock.txt for reproducibility
- Created ARCHITECTURE.md with detailed design docs
- Created API key setup guide
- Created tracing documentation
- Professional, complete documentation suite

## Files Created/Modified
- `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- `requirements.txt` - Finalized dependencies
- `requirements-lock.txt` - Exact version snapshot
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture documentation
- `docs/API_KEY_SETUP.md` - API key guide
- `docs/TRACING.md` - Tracing system docs

## Decisions Made
- README under 300 lines (concise but complete)
- Separate docs for deep-dives (architecture, API, tracing)
- requirements.txt uses >= for flexibility
- requirements-lock.txt for exact reproducibility
- Step-by-step instructions prioritized

## Issues Encountered
[Document any issues, or "None"]

## Next Step
Ready for 06-03-PLAN.md (Final testing, polish, and verification)
